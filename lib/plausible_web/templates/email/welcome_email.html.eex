Hey <%= user_salutation(@user) %>,
<br /><br />
We are building Plausible to provide a simple and ethical approach to tracking website visitors.
We're super excited to have you on board!
<br /><br />
Here are five steps to get the most out of your Plausible experience:
<br /><br />
* Serve the script as a <%= link("first party connection from your custom domain", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/custom-domain") %><br />
* <%= link("Enable email reports", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/email-reports/") %> and notifications for <%= link("traffic spikes", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/traffic-spikes/") %><br />
* <%= link("Integrate with Search Console", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/google-search-console-integration/") %> to get keyword phrases people find your site with<br />
* Set up some easy goals including <%= link("404 error pages", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/404-error-pages-tracking") %> and <%= link("outbound link clicks", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/outbound-link-click-tracking/") %><br />
* <%= link("Opt out from counting your own visits", to: "https://docs.plausible.io/excluding/") %><br />
<br /><br />
Then you're ready to start exploring your fast loading, ethical and actionable <%= link("Plausible dashboard", to: "https://plausible.io/sites") %>.
